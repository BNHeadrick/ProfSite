I'm a recent graduate of The Georgia Instute of Technology where I recieved my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Media and my Masters of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Interactive Intelligence.

Beginning with my final year at college, I began focusing my time on mobile and web development.

Other than academia, I'm an amatuer musician with over a decade of experience with percussian instruments and a year of guitar.
